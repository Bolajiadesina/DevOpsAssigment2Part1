# Introduction to Operating Systems:

## What is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) is software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and user applications. It manages computer resources, provides a user interface, and facilitates communication between software and hardware components.

## Tasks of an Operating System:

- Process management: Allocating system resources to running programs, scheduling tasks, and managing processes.
Memory management: Allocating and managing system memory to ensure efficient use of available resources.
- File system management: Organizing and managing files and directories on storage devices, including file access and storage optimization.
- Device management: Managing input/output devices such as keyboards, printers, and disk drives, including device drivers and access control.
- User interface: Providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the computer system, including command-line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI).

## Components of an Operating System:

- Kernel: The core component of the operating system that manages hardware resources and provides essential services.
User interface: The component that enables users to interact with the operating system, including command-line interfaces, graphical user interfaces, and application programming interfaces (APIs).
- Device drivers: Software modules that facilitate communication between the operating system and hardware devices.
- System libraries: Collections of reusable code and functions that provide additional functionality to applications and developers.
- Utilities: System tools and utilities for performing various tasks such as file management, system configuration, and network administration.

## Types of Operating Systems:

- Single-user/single-tasking: Supports one user and one task at a time, typical of early personal computers.
- Single-user/multi-tasking: Supports one user with multiple concurrent tasks, allowing for multitasking and time-sharing.
- Multi-user: Supports multiple users simultaneously, providing concurrent access to system resources and applications.
- Real-time: Designed for applications that require deterministic response times and strict timing constraints, such as industrial control systems and embedded devices.
- Networked: Designed for distributed computing environments, facilitating communication and resource sharing across networked devices.

## Linux Operating System:
Linux is a popular open-source operating system kernel based on Unix-like principles. It is widely used in servers, desktop computers, embedded systems, and mobile devices. Linux distributions (distros) combine the Linux kernel with additional software packages and tools to create complete operating system environments.

## Introduction to Virtualization and Virtual Machines:

### What is a Server?

A server is a computer system or software application that provides services or resources to other computers or users within a network. Servers can serve various purposes, including file storage, web hosting, database management, and network communication.

### The concept of Virtualization:
Virtualization is the process of creating virtual instances of computer resources, such as hardware, operating systems, storage devices, and networks. Virtualization allows multiple virtual environments (virtual machines) to run simultaneously on a single physical machine, enabling greater flexibility, resource utilization, and cost-efficiency.

### What is a Virtual Machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer system that runs on a host machine (physical server). Each VM operates as an independent instance with its own virtualized hardware, operating system, and applications, allowing multiple virtual environments to coexist on the same physical hardware.

### What is a hypervisor?
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software that enables the creation and management of virtual machines on a physical host machine. The hypervisor abstracts and controls the underlying hardware resources, facilitating the allocation and isolation of resources for virtual machines.

### Physical Machine vs Virtual Machine:

- Physical machine: A physical computer system consisting of hardware components such as processors, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices. It runs a single operating system instance directly on the hardware.
- Virtual machine: A software emulation of a physical computer system that runs on a physical host machine. It operates as an independent instance with its own virtualized hardware, operating system, and applications, allowing multiple virtual environments to coexist on the same physical hardware.
